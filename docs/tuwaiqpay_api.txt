1. Authentication API
Before making any API calls, you need to authenticate and obtain an access token. The
authentication endpoint validates your credentials and returns an access token.
P O S T /api/v1/auth/authenticate
Request Headers
Header Required Description
Content-Type Yes application/json
X-Language No Language code (ar, en). Default: en
Request Body
{
    "username": "+966000000000",
    "userNameType": "MOBILE",
    "password": "P@SSWORD"
}
Request Parameters
Parameter Type Required Description
username String Yes User's mobile number or email address
userNameType String Yes Type of username: "MOBILE" or "EMAIL"
password String Yes User's password
Sample cURL Request
curl --location 'https://onboarding-
prod.tuwaiqpay.com.sa/api/v1/auth/authenticate' \
--header 'X-Language: ar' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "username": "+966000000000",
    "userNameType": "MOBILE",
    "password": "P@SSWORD"
}'

}
Note: Store the access_token securely. You will need to include it in the
Authorization header for all subsequent API requests. The access token has a
limited lifetime.
2. Create Bill API
Use this endpoint to create a new bill that customers can pay. The API returns a
payment link and QR code that can be used by customers to complete the payment.

Response Fields
Field Type Description
link StringPayment link that customers can use to pay
the bill
qrCode String QR code URL for mobile payments
transactionId String Unique transaction identifier
merchantTransactionId String Merchant's transaction reference
billId Long Bill identifier
expireDate DateTimeBill expiration date and time
Important: Share the payment link or QR code with your customer. Once they
complete the payment, a webhook will be sent to your configured endpoint with
the payment details.
3. Webhooks
Webhooks allow TuwaiqPay to send real-time notifications to your system when
payment events occur. This enables you to update your system immediately when a
customer completes a payment.
Webhook Configuration
To configure webhooks, you need to provide TuwaiqPay with a POST endpoint URL
where we will send payment notifications. Please share your webhook endpoint URL
with the TuwaiqPay integration team.
Example Webhook URL: https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/tuwaiqpay-
payment
Webhook Request
When a customer completes a payment, TuwaiqPay will send a POST request to your
webhook endpoint with the payment details in the request body.
P O S T {Your Webhook Endpoint URL}
Webhook Headers
TuwaiqPay includes a verification header in all webhook requests to allow you to verify
that the request originates from TuwaiqPay's system. During the integration setup, you
can share your own custom header key and value with the TuwaiqPay integration team.
If you do not provide custom credentials, TuwaiqPay will use the default verification
header values.
Default Verification Header: If no custom header key and value are provided
during integration setup, TuwaiqPay will use the following default values:
Header Key: x-signature
Header Value: Tuwaiqpay
Header Required Description
x-signature (default)
or Custom KeyYesVerification header key. Default is 'x-
signature' if custom key not provided.
Tuwaiqpay (default) or
Custom ValueYesVerification header value. Default is
'Tuwaiqpay' if custom value not provided.
Content-Type Yes application/json
Custom Header Setup: If you would like to use your own custom header key and
value for webhook verification, please share them with the TuwaiqPay integration
team during the setup process. Your custom credentials will be securely stored
and used for all webhook requests sent to your endpoint.
Security Requirement: Always verify the webhook signature header before
processing any webhook requests. Compare the header key and value with the
credentials provided (either custom or default) to ensure the request is authentic
and originates from TuwaiqPay's system. Reject any requests that fail verification.

Webhook Payload Fields
Field Type Description
transactionId String Unique transaction identifier
merchantTransactionId String Your original transaction reference
transactionStatus StringPayment status (e.g.,
PENDING_SETTLEMENT, PAID, FAILED)
Field Type Description

Webhook Implementation Requirements
1. Your webhook endpoint must accept POST requests
2. The endpoint should return HTTP 200 status code upon successful processing
3. Implement idempotency to handle duplicate webhook calls
4. Process webhooks asynchronously to avoid timeouts
5. Log all webhook requests for debugging and audit purposes
6. Validate the webhook payload structure before processing
Security Note: Always validate webhook requests. Consider implementing
signature verification if provided by TuwaiqPay. Never expose sensitive operations
through your webhook endpoint without proper authentication.
Best Practice: Respond to webhook requests quickly (within 5 seconds). If
processing takes longer, acknowledge the webhook immediately and process it
asynchronously in the background.
4. Supported Payment Methods
TuwaiqPay supports multiple payment methods. You can specify which payment
methods to offer when creating a bill through the supportedPaymentMethods array.
Payment Method Code Description
VISA Visa credit and debit cards
MASTER Mastercard credit and debit cards
MADA MADA debit cards (Saudi Arabia)
AMEX American Express cards
5. Error Handling
All API endpoints return standard HTTP status codes. In case of an error, the response
will include an error message in the following format:
{
    "message": "Error description",
    "errors": ["Detailed error messages"]
}
Common HTTP Status Codes
Status Code Description
200 Success
400 Bad Request - Invalid parameters
401 Unauthorized - Invalid or expired token
403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions
404 Not Found - Resource does not exist
500 Internal Server Error
